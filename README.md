# ARDoCo Inconsistency Detection

The goal of this project is to identify missing or deviating elements (inconsistencies) between artifacts like software architecture documentation, software architecture, and code.
For more information about the ARDoCo project visit the website at [ardoco.de](https://ardoco.de).

ARDoCo is actively developed by researchers of
the _[Modelling for Continuous Software Engineering (MCSE) group](https://mcse.kastel.kit.edu)_
of _[KASTEL - Institute of Information Security and Dependability](https://kastel.kit.edu)_ at
the [KIT](https://www.kit.edu).
